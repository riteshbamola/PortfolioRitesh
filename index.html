        <h3>Class 1: Self-Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Self introduction session has been a valuable learning Our teacher
          emphasized the importance of maintaining eye contact, speaking
          clearly, and presenting myself with confidence. The structured
          approach to self-introduction helped me refine my communication
          skills.
          <br /><br />
          I learned to start with my name, schooling, and current education,
          ensuring a smooth introduction. The next key aspect was elaborating on
          my projects, where I explained the technologies used, challenges
          faced, and the impact of my work. This taught me how to highlight my
          technical skills effectively.
          <br /><br />
          Discussing my achievements and certifications helped me recognize
          their significance in shaping my career. Additionally, structuring my
          goalsâ€”focusing on becoming a skilled software engineer in a reputed
          companyâ€”allowed me to express my aspirations clearly.
          <br /><br />
          Lastly, concluding with a brief mention of my family background added a
          personal touch, making my introduction well-rounded and engaging.

        <h3>Class 2: Extempore</h3>
        <p>
          In our recent class, our teacher emphasized the importance of
          confidence, clarity, and structured thinking while delivering an
          extempore speech. Since extempore requires speaking on the spot, I
          learned that quick thinking and organizing ideas efficiently are
          crucial.Our teacher highlighted the P-R-E-P method (Point, Reason,
          Example, and Point) to structure responses logically.
          <br /><br />
          Starting with a clear introduction, supporting the topic with relevant
          points, and concluding strongly helps make an impact.Another key
          learning was time managementâ€”balancing content within the given time
          limit without rushing or pausing too much.
          <br /><br />
          Voice modulation, eye contact, and hand gestures were also stressed to
          engage the audience.Practicing regularly and staying informed about
          current affairs were additional tips that will help in improving my
          extempore speaking skills.

        <h3>Class 3: Resume Building</h3>
        <p>
          In our recent class, the teacher emphasized the importance of creating
          a clear, well-structured, and professional resume to make a strong
          first impression. I learned that a resume should be concise, highlight
          key achievements, and be tailored to the job role.
          <br /><br />
          The teacher stressed the importance of starting with a strong summary,
          followed by sections like education, technical skills, projects,
          internships, and certifications. Listing projects in detail, including
          the technologies used and their impact, helps showcase practical
          experience.
          <br /><br />
          Another key takeaway was to use action-oriented words while describing
          roles and achievements to make the resume more impactful. The teacher
          also highlighted the significance of proper formatting, consistency,
          and avoiding unnecessary details.Additionally, customizing the resume
          for each job, keeping it updated, and ensuring error-free content were
          stressed.
          <br /><br />
          I understood that a well-crafted resume can open doors to interviews,
          making it an essential tool for career growth.

        <h3>Class 4: Video Call Etiquette</h3>
        <p>
          In the video call etiquette session, our teacher emphasized the
          importance of professionalism, clear communication, and appropriate
          behavior in virtual meetings. I learned to ensure good lighting and a
          quiet environment, dress appropriately, and maintain eye contact by
          looking at the camera.
          <br /><br />
          The teacher also stressed muting the microphone when not speaking to
          avoid background noise and using the chat function for questions or
          comments. Being punctual and prepared were additional tips shared.
          <br /><br />
          I understood that virtual communication skills are increasingly
          important in todayâ€™s remote work culture and require practice to
          master.

      <article class="topic-section">
        <h3>Class 5: Public Speaking</h3>
        <p><strong>ðŸŽ¤ What is Public Speaking?</strong><br />
          Public speaking is the act of delivering a speech or presentation to an audience. Itâ€™s not just about
          talking in front of people; itâ€™s about communicating your ideas clearly, confidently, and effectively.
          Whether you're giving a class presentation, pitching an idea at work, or speaking at a conference, public
          speaking is a vital skill that can open many doors.</p>

        <h4>ðŸ’¡ Why Public Speaking Matters</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boosts Confidence:</strong> The more you speak in front of others, the more confident you become.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Improves Communication Skills:</strong> Helps you articulate thoughts better and listen actively.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Enhances Career Growth:</strong> Employers value individuals who can present ideas persuasively.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Builds Leadership Qualities:</strong> Great leaders are often great speakers.</li>
          <li><strong>Encourages Critical Thinking:</strong> Preparing for a speech sharpens your ability to structure
            thoughts logically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>ðŸ§  Key Elements of Effective Public Speaking</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Know your topic thoroughly. Research your audience and tailor your message
            accordingly. Structure your speech using a simple format: Introduction â†’ Body â†’ Conclusion.</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity and Conciseness:</strong> Speak clearly and avoid jargon unless necessary. Keep your
            message focused and easy to follow. Avoid unnecessary details that might distract your audience.</li>
          <li><strong>Body Language:</strong> Maintain eye contact to build trust. Use hand gestures and facial
            expressions to emphasize points. Stand tall and avoid slouching or fidgeting, as body language plays a big
            role in how your message is received.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice Modulation:</strong> Vary pitch, tone, and pace to keep the audience engaged. Pause after
            important points to let them sink in. A monotone voice can lose attention quickly â€” use vocal variety to
            maintain interest.</li>
          <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Start with a hook â€” a question, quote, or short story. Ask rhetorical or
            direct questions to involve your audience. Make them feel like part of the conversation rather than passive
            listeners.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Essay: Blockchain Technology</h3>
        <p>
          Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that has transformed how we store and transfer information securely.
          Initially introduced as the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has now expanded its reach
          into various industries such as banking, healthcare, supply chain, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers
          in a way that prevents tampering and fraud. Each block contains a list of transactions and once added to the
          chain, altering past blocks becomes extremely difficult.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unlike traditional systems controlled by a central authority, blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer
            network.</li>
          <li>All participants can view the transaction history, making it trustworthy.</li>
          <li>Cryptographic techniques ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Blockchain is widely used in cryptocurrency, but its applications go far beyond that. In healthcare, it helps
          secure patient records. In supply chains, it tracks product origins. Governments are exploring its use for
          voting
          systems and land records.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology offers a promising future with its secure, transparent, and decentralized nature. As it
          continues to evolve, it will likely play a major role in shaping digital innovation across industries.
